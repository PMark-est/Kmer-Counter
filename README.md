# Kmer-Counter is a tool for gathering data about bacteria

This is a tool to count the amount of times a k-mer appears across multiple fna/fasta files. It also keeps track of how many of the seen kmers are resistant or susceptible(to an antibiotic).

[This](<https://www.bv-brc.org/view/Taxonomy/1763#view_tab=amr&filter=and(eq(evidence,%22Laboratory%20Method%22),eq(antibiotic,%22amoxicillin%22))>) serves as an example that we count k-mers for the bacteria "Mycobacterium.tuberculosis" about the antibiotic amoxicillin, the genomes are indicated as susceptible or resistant to the drug.
